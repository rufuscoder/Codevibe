Codevibe
=================
This is a basic code editor for the web. You save on the server side while your editing it. No more uploading or downloading
Its all just there. We are going to be using these APIs:

alertify.js
------------
Bootstrap
------------
Codemirror
------------
heyoffline.js
-------------



We will be using more APIs in the future.
